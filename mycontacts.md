Dear Larry,

I think our last meeting was in Kampala back in the summer of 2019. You spoke highly of Hopkins then, appreciating it for two significant reasons: a pivotal stage in your career with MU-JHU, and your surgical oncologist from Emory University, who had trained under Dr. John Cameron, my former Chair of Surgery at Hopkins.

Your recent update on the 15-year journey under modern care for pancreatic tumors fills me with hope! The Peptide Receptor Radioisotope Therapy (PRRT), along with gamma knife radiation, among other treatments, sounds very promising. We are grateful that these interventions have brought positive outcomes throughout this extensive journey.

Sonja's situation also deeply moved me. The distance and circumstances indeed make it challenging, but rest assured, we'll reach out to her with words of encouragement, hoping our collective support offers her some solace.

As for the planned visit, we are looking forward to it with great anticipation. Your detailed itinerary is incredibly helpful for planning on my end, and I'm thankful you've kept us in the loop amidst everything that's happening. A special thanks to Martin for making sure I received this update, ensuring I'm included in the loop. I'll make sure my schedule is aligned so we can maximize our time together.

I realized I hadn't shared my contact information with you:
- Email: muzaale@gmail.com
- Phone & WhatsApp: (240) 281-3154

Please don't hesitate to get in touch, whether for planning, updates, or just to chat.

Sending all my love, prayers, and best wishes for the ongoing treatments. Here's to hoping for more joyful times together, in Sonoma and beyond.

Warmest regards,

Abi

Dear Patrick, Lucy, Abimereki and Martin,

My cancer scan 10 days ago showed I have several rapidly growing neuroendocrine tumors, including one in my pelvis that is causing a lot of hip pain and leaves me walking with a cane. I will have a repeat of the Peptide Receptor Radioisotope Therapy (PRRT) that is given IV and will target all of the tumors all over my body and also regular gamma knife radiation to the tumor near my right hip. I'll have two treatments with PRRT, on February 28th and at the end of April. 

Sonja was admitted to the hospital at Stanford and will probably be there for 10 days to test some medications to control her low blood sugar. Genetic testing revealed a variant of an abnormal gene that causes Glycogen Storage Disease type 6 because of a defect in the body's ability to store sugar in the liver. Since the hospital is 4 hours drive away, it is very difficult to visit her, so she would love a chat or email of encouragement.

I anticipate that my treatment will be finished by early May so that our planned visit with you here in Sonora will not be affected. We will need to go into San Francisco on Wednesday May 22nd for a followup scan. Perhaps we can all ride together when you go to Oakland. We now have tickets to Kenya, departing from San Jose on Thursday the 23rd, so our visit will need to be a day shorter. We are so looking forward to this reunion.

I can't find Abimereki's contacts: email or phone in the US. We are looking forward to seeing you and as the time is closer, let's talk to make more detailed plans. 

With our love,
Larry and Elizabeth
