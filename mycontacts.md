Dear Larry,

I think our last meeting was in Kampala, back in the summer of 2017. You spoke highly of Hopkins then, appreciating it for two significant reasons: a pivotal stage in your career with MUJHU, and your surgical oncologist from Emory University, who had trained under Dr. John Cameron, my former Chair of Surgery at Hopkins.

Your recent update on the 15-year journey under modern care for pancreatic tumors fills me with hope! The Peptide Receptor Radioisotope Therapy (PRRT), along with gamma knife radiation, among other treatments, sounds very promising. We are grateful that these interventions have brought positive outcomes throughout this extensive journey.

Sonja's situation also deeply moved me. The distance and circumstances indeed make it challenging, but rest assured, we'll reach out to her with words of encouragement, hoping our collective support offers her some solace.

As for the planned visit, we are looking forward to it with great anticipation. Your detailed itinerary is incredibly helpful for planning on my end, and I'm thankful you've kept us in the loop amidst everything that's happening. I'll make sure my schedule is aligned so we can maximize our time together.

I realized I hadn't shared my contact information with you:
- Email: muzaale@gmail.com
- Phone & WhatsApp: (240) 281-3154

Please don't hesitate to get in touch, whether for planning, updates, or just to chat.

Sending all my love, prayers, and best wishes for the ongoing treatments. Here's to hoping for more joyful times together, in Sonora and beyond.

Warmest regards,

Abi
