Dear family and friends,

This is Larry, writing on Elizabeth's email, as I am having trouble getting onto my email on her computer and writing on my phone is too slow. I look out over intense tropical greenery, fresh with recent rains, our pool, and the Indian Ocean beyond, with its ever changing turquoise and azure blues. I do hope in the coming years that those of you who have not seen this Kilifi paradise will come with us one year so we can share it together. We are here with Paul, [Cicely](https://doctors.adventisthealth.org/provider/Cicely+Chen/1342158)[,](https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/health-fitness/adventist-health-sonora-welcomes-new-ob-gyn-cicely-chen-m-d) Tristan and Alanna, along with a college roommate friend of Cicely's, [Kathy](https://scholar.harvard.edu/kevans/home) [Evans](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/3171239/2022/03/09/nba-40-under-40-katherine-evans-has-a-harvard-ph-d-shes-using-it-to-lead-the-d-c-basketball-analytics-department/)[.](https://www.nba.com/wizards/dr-katherine-evans-named-vp-research-information-systems-monumental-basketball) 

They just had a wonderful safari at Lewa Downs, a Conservancy we visited 30 years ago, where they rode horses among herds of giraffe, zebra and antelope, saw lion and elephant from close quarters at night and observed the large numbers of rhino in their successful recovery program. Lewa is also the site of one of the highest altitude marathons, at the foot of snow capped Mount Kenya.

 We are all ready for some relaxing down time here in Kilifi to complete Cicely's maternity leave and Paul's paternity leave before they return to work in July. As always, we are enjoying the fresh pineapple, mango, and locally caught seafood.

Let me first digress, however, and share our days before and during travel. We had a wonderful reunion in Sonora with Patrick and Lucy Muzaale and their son Abi for several days before we departed. Long friendships are certainly a treasure, and a half century is a rarity. Patrick came to Berkeley in 1975 and studied social welfare with Elizabeth in 1975, Lucy came the next year and Abi was born in Berkeley and is now a kidney transplant surgeon on the faculty of Johns Hopkins. In addition to our time with the Muzaales in Sonora, we stayed in Oakland with Stan and Connie Weisner, with much to reminisce and savor in our intertwined paths.

In early May on Yosemite Road, the green of spring, with grass growing inches a day, changed quickly to the dry colors of summer. I was able to mow the fields for fire protection, and set up a new pump and irrigation system for the orchard. The weeks before departure were aso filled with music: our Columbia College Community Chorus concert singing a Schubert Mass, some Alice Parker arrangements and an ethereal Eric Whitaker antidote to pandemic , "Sing Gently"; a Sierra Waldorf School spring concert that included a parent/grandparent/alumni choir singing Brahms "How lovely is thy dwelling place"; and our Unitarian Universalist Fellowship Choir's monthly performance. In this challenging year, music has been therapeutic for me. 

With my old sacral fracture and two recent pelvic fractures, one from a fast-growing metastatic tumor and the other on the opposite side of the pubic ring, I don't have a good leg to stand on or a good butt cheek to sit on. Anticipating challenges to travel, I asked for wheelchair assistance in the airports and travelled with a rolling walker, a cane, and trekking poles. In Paris the plane arrived late, as did the assistance, so we had to trek between terminals, loading our carryon bags onto my walker, hoofing it to the bus and the gate in the next terminal, but we made the plane and arrived Friday night and stayed at our Nairobi oasis, the Muthaiga Club. I am still limited, using a walker or walking sticks, but I will continue the prescribed physical therapy routines and hope for continued healing. An MRI on our return will determine if I need additional radioisotope therapy for the new tumors.

Our travels, though, became more complicated when I developed upper respiratory symptoms and tested positive for COVID. I moved to a separate bedroom and masked,  Elizabeth remained negative, and no one else has developed any symptoms. I was still somewhat weak and have a low lymphocyte count from the radioisotope therapy a month ago and I suspect that my susceptibility was partly due to those factors, but I feel fully recovered now and appreciate the restorative properties of Kilifi and the physical therapy .  

We will try to stay in touch with many of you individually during this month, but wanted to share this news collectively. We hope you are all well as the summer holidays approach.

With our love and best wishes,
Larry and Elizabeth
