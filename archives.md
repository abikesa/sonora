Dear Patrick, Lucy, Abimereki and Martin,

My cancer scan 10 days ago showed I have several rapidly growing neuroendocrine tumors, including one in my pelvis that is causing a lot of hip pain and leaves me walking with a cane. I will have a repeat of the Peptide Receptor Radioisotope Therapy (PRRT) that is given IV and will target all of the tumors all over my body and also regular gamma knife radiation to the tumor near my right hip. I'll have two treatments with PRRT, on February 28th and at the end of April. 

Sonja was admitted to the hospital at Stanford and will probably be there for 10 days to test some medications to control her low blood sugar. Genetic testing revealed a variant of an abnormal gene that causes Glycogen Storage Disease type 6 because of a defect in the body's ability to store sugar in the liver. Since the hospital is 4 hours drive away, it is very difficult to visit her, so she would love a chat or email of encouragement.

I anticipate that my treatment will be finished by early May so that our planned visit with you here in Sonora will not be affected. We will need to go into San Francisco on Wednesday May 22nd for a followup scan. Perhaps we can all ride together when you go to Oakland. We now have tickets to Kenya, departing from San Jose on Thursday the 23rd, so our visit will need to be a day shorter. We are so looking forward to this reunion.

I can't find Abimereki's contacts: email or phone in the US. We are looking forward to seeing you and as the time is closer, let's talk to make more detailed plans. 

With our love,
Larry and Elizabeth

Dear East African family,

We have had an eventful several weeks, so I thought I would send a longer email to all of you collectively. We went on a trip to Mexico City and returned a week ago. We were with a  young couple, Chip Huyen and her partner, Luke Metz. Both work in the field of Artificial Intelligence.  We were able to see the famous pyramids of Teotihuacan, the anthropology museum, the Ballet Folklorica, beautiful parks and the floating gardens, and several museums, including Frida Khalo's house and the Diego Rivera murals at the National Palace. Mexico City, with 22 million people has a rich and interesting history.

Elizabeth came back with cold-like symptoms, and, despite careful mask use, I came back with COVID. My symptoms have been very mild (no fever and mild cold-like symptoms), and I took the anti-viral Paxlovid. I am isolating in our guest room and office and, thankfully, Elizabeth has not caught the disease. She had her knees injected on Friday with acellular treatment in hopes of improving the cartilege and avoiding a second knee replacement. 

I had a video visit Monday with my UCSF oncology NP to review my latest scans. While I have several tumors that are new in the past 2 years, they are small and growing slowly, so it is premature to treat them with radiation or chemotherapy.  I'm attaching a picture that compares my scan earlier this year (left) with the one I had before PRRT in July 2020. Those lesions have either disappeared or have shrunk and remain inactive -- a better than expected result from the intravenous radiation (PRRT) that I had between August 2020 and February 2021. I've labeled the normal organs the radioisotope is found on the recent scan and the many tumors seen in the 2020 scan, My next followup DOTA MRI (radioisotope) scan will be in February. I am so grateful that this new intravenous radiation treatment worked so well for me.  I will undoubtedly need more treatment in the future, but the new tumors are, for now, growing slowly.

I hope we can speak or video chat with all of you in the next few weeks and wish all a very happy Christmas.

Love,
Doctor and Jaja

Dear East African Family,

On Friday, February 3rd, I had a scan -- a PET MRI Dotatate whole body scan to see if I have a resurgence of my cancer. I got the results last week and I'm still trying to digest them, because they are mixed -- some new tumors growing in my bones and lymph nodes, but still a good result with the old tumors smaller and inactive. I still haven't heard from the doctor about what the next steps should be. I'll try to explain this type of special scan -- don't hesitate to ask questions. 

The Dotatate is a radioisotope scan that attaches specifically to tumor cells and to neuroendocrine organs like the pituitary, adrenal glands and pancreas - basically a whole body geiger counter that shows tumor activity. The PET MRI gives a better picture of tissues to show tumor size and shape.

In the last 12 plus years I've had nearly 50 scans and each one comes with uncertain expectations and often mixed results. Two, however, have stood out in their clarity: in 2020 when the results were "too numerous to count new metastases in liver and bone" it resulted in the start of PRRT, the intravenous radiation that attaches to tumors with a radiation dose 50 times greater than that of the scan, and in 2022 with the "Amazing response to PRRT - no tumor functional activity".

The results from Friday just came out today, and I also received a copy of Dr. Bergsland's notes, 11 pages long, outlining that 12 year history and her recommendations. First, I have several small new tumors, in a lymph node, rib and pelvis. Dr. Bergsland characterized this as "slight progressive disease" 2 years after the very successful PRRT. I still have the fracture of my sacrum which has caused me to retire my downhill skis and limits how far I can hike and what I can safely carry. I also continue to have episodes of cholangitis and fever from bacteria going upstream into the liver's biliary system, including one yesterday with a several hour fever up to 102.6F.  I may need additional radiation for the active bony tumors or restart the monthly targeted chemotherapy injections that were stopped last August. But overall, this is a very good report and I am glad to be doing this well after 12 years living with pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer.

Thanks to all of you for your encouragement, calls, thoughts and prayers on this cancer journey. An editorial in 1986 in the New England Journal of Medicine by a pediatrician and double cancer survivor described living with cancer as accepting and embracing uncertainty. Twenty five years later I hosted a dinner for a visiting team supporting the University of Zambia Medical School, described my cancer and mentioned that editorial, without knowing that the author was standing in front of me! So while there is uncertainty in this report, I am ever grateful for the high tech diagnostic and treatment options that have kept me alive and (relatively) well.

We are planning to come to Kenya in August and September and hope to see many of you in Kilifi. Our time there will be complicated so I can't yet give firm dates, but probably the last two weeks in August or early September will be best. Our partner Buck is coming sometime in September, but we don't yet know how long. We are also having several couples from California coming at different times. We will let you know but hope we can see you in 2023.

Love,
Larry

Just seen this. Amazing that we are talking of a 12 year history of pancreatic cancer.

Amazing. Would you mind writing Larry and Elizabeth with your thoughts on this?

Amazing news from Larry. There's certainly been great leaps in cancer research and treatment.

 Dear Uganda and Kenya Family, 

I have wonderful news to share. I've just finished a zoom visit with Dr. Thomas Hope, the radiation oncologist (appropriately named) at University of California San Francisco who treated me with four courses of Peptide Receptor Radioisotope Therapy (PRRT) from August 2020 to February 2021. I was told that it would take a year to see the full results. The radionuclide scan that I had two weeks ago showed a complete (yes, complete) resolution of active disease. Dr. Hope said I am the first patient of the 160 that he has treated with PRRT to show a complete resolution. The MRI showed continued shrinking of the size of the tumors, and no new tumors were detected. The contrast to the scan before PRRT in July 2020 is dramatic: that scan demonstrated that the dozen metastases in my liver and bones were growing and there were "too numerous to count" new metastases. This disease is not gone; it will in all likelihood recur, but, as Dr. Hope said, he expects to have me as a patient for a long time!

There is a small wrinkle, however, in this wonderful news. The largest tumor at the base of my spine (now about 4.5 x 4.5 x 1 cm) that crosses the ileo-sacral joint that joins spine to the pelvis, has had a fracture that started in 2020 and has extended across the sacrum. This may explain the pain and limp that I have been having, especially when walking on uneven surfaces or walking more than a kilometer. I've had a couple courses of physical therapy that have helped strengthen the muscles and increase my mobility. I have been able to downhill ski this winter, continue to work in our orchard and on our property, but have avoided heavy lifting -- undoubtedly a good thing. I see the orthopedic oncologist next week to learn if I need any additional treatment.

I did have a health scare a couple weeks ago, with an obstruction in my small intestine. This likely came from scar tissue from my original surgery nearly 12 years ago. It took about 5 days of only liquid diet, but thankfully it resolved. About 40-60% of the time with an obstruction like that, it requires surgery, so I am fortunate. 

I want to thank all of you for your love and support during this 12 year cancer journey. I am ever grateful that new treatments have become available when I needed the treatment and also for a great health care team, from the surgeon in Atlanta to the oncologist and radiologists in San Francisco.

We are still enjoying taking care of Tristan during the week. It has been unseasonably warm lately, so it is fun to be outside exploring with him. It is expected to turn cold again and we may have snow on Saturday.

Love,
Doctor Larry and Jaja

Hadn’t realized that he is his thirteenth yearsince diagnosis. Most definitely a tail event based on the 5-year survival rates that we used to communicate to patients. But also possible a glimpse into the future—

Dear Patrick, Lucy and Martin,

Thank you for your emails and messages, and especially for your thoughts and prayers. This news of many new tumors in my bones and liver was disappointing, but not surprising, as this type of neuroendocrine cancer is slow growing but relentless in its metastatic spread. The largest tumor, a flat, pancake-shaped 6.5cm by 5.5 cm tumor at the base of my left spine, is in a delicate area where the nerve may be compressed. This was treated by radiation 3 years ago and shrank for a time. I was in San Francisco on Monday to scan that area and plan another dose of local (gamma-knife) radiation, which will be given over 5 days in mid-September.

I am also going to receive the Peptide Receptor Radioisotope Therapy (PRRT) one week from today, on August 26th, and every 8 weeks for a total of 4 treatments. This type of radiation is given intravenously and attached to the tumor cells. I am attaching a description of how it works from the company that makes it. I am grateful that these scientific advancements have come when I have needed them, and I will continue on the monthly injections that have slowed the growth of the tumors for the past 5 years. I continue to appreciate the irony of my survival due to very high tech interventions after working for decades to improve the basic health care for women, children and people with HIV.

I treasure the 45 year friendship that we have had and the support of your whole family. I'm copying others. I hope that in 2021 we will again be able to travel to East Africa and celebrate with a family reunion. I hope you are all staying well in these pandemic times. Uganda's response to the epidemic, while difficult for all of you, is so much more effective than this country's response.

With our love,
Larry

Dear Larry

Thank you for your latest email informing us about the video conference with Dr Emily bergsland,the neuroendocrine tumour specialist at UCSF whose purpose was to review your recent scan results.

We were deeply concerned about the results of the scan.Although the information about the results were highly technical, we were able to tell that recent interventions were not successful in reducing the existing tumours or preventing new ones from developing,and that another phase of interventions will have to start before long after a tumour review board, holding four sessions

We praise God for the courage he has granted you to handle gracefully this painful and delicate phase of your treatment.Further, we are grateful to the Lord who has granted you the ability to appreciate the doctors' efforts and health benefits they have been able to secure for you, in spite of the increase in the number and size of tumours detected.

We pray to our loving God to guide the hands of the doctors who will be handling the next phase of treatments so that their interventions will result in more "quality years of life ahead" Further, we thank the Lord who has granted Elizabeth the fortitude to help you carry your cross while still carrying her own as well.

We are constantly praying for both of you to overcome your health challenges.

With lots of love
Patrick.


1.Local radiation (Lower spine)
— Targeted externally
— Gamma radiation damaged tumor DNA
— More focused than classical X-ray, Less than #2 below

2.Molecular target (Delta cells)
— Targets delta cells of pancreatic origin, wherever they are
— Delta cells have molecular “locks”
— PRRT is “key” that unlocks delta cell.. to deliver lethal Beta radiation

Both modalities are for tumors that have spread across the body. The first one for an easy to identify & target secondary location. The second for whichever nook and cranny a metastasis with the molecular signature of interest is “hiding in”

Dear Martin,
First, let me send greetings from the extended Marum family to the extended Muzaale family!  We hope this finds all of you well.  I cannot seem to find Patrick and Lucy's email address so I will very much appreciate your forwarding this email to your parents and to your brother Patrick, and also sending me their addresses.

Next, let me ask how work is going at USAID Uganda?  I'll be eager to hear.  I am actually on a short term contract with USAID/Malawi.  Since we lived in Malawi from 98 to 2000, it is very nice to be back!  My contract goes until the end of Feb.

Larry is flying out to Malawi on 16 Feb to join me for a brief visit.  Then, on Saturday, 2 March, our Ugandan daughter Josephine Katumba, is getting married at Namirembe Cathedral, and we are planning to come for the wedding.  S, o of course we are hoping to have a reunion with you, your brother, your families, and your parents.

We have just bought tickets (using KLM miles) so we will depart Lilongwe at 9:40 am, transit through Nairobi, and arrive Entebbe 14:05.  However, the transit time in Nairobi is only one hour, and KQ here in Malawi does not have a good track record in terms of being on time, so I'm afraid there is a good chance that we'll miss the early connection to Entebbe and have to wait until a flight that won't arrive in EBB until 19:50.  I am sorry to bore you with all these details but I want to explain why we do not want to make any plans to see you on Thursday 28 Feb as our arrival time in Entebbe is somewhat uncertain.

However-- we have no plans for Friday 1 March and we hope we can organize a reunion with the Muzaale clan on 1 March.  Josephine and Nicholas will no doubt be very busy on that Friday so we are free to make our own plans-- and we sincerely hope that can include a reunion with all of you.

We will be staying at the Royal Suites Hotel in Bugalobi as that is where the wedding dinner will be, and then Larry and I plan to host a Sunday morning brunch there for the two wedding families on 3 March, and then we'll leave for the airport to fly to Nairobi and then on to Mombasa/Kilifi where we hope to spend a couple of weeks relaxing at our lovely home in Kilifi.  (And, by the way, when are you all coming to see us in Kilifi??)

We fly back to California in late March, and then our son Paul is getting married in California on May 4-- so this is a year with two weddings in our family!  One of the reasons I accepted this USAID contract was to help cover the expenses associated with two weddings in one year, though of course the main reason I'm working is that I find the work so meaningful and professionally stimulating.

I'm also pleased to tell you that Larry's health is reasonably OK.  He has had some tumors grow a little bit and is now on a daily pill form of chemotherapy, and he had very targeted radiation to these small tumors in January.  In spite of these medical challenges, he remains very active-- skiing, swimming, and he's currently building a barn on our property!  His doctors have cleared him for this travel to Africa-- I doubt that he even tried to explain that this trip will involve travel to Malawi, Kenya, and Uganda as Americans are so ignorant about African geography, as you know.

I will try to attach to this email our Christmas letter and card-- sorry they are so late.  The photo of the house is our new retirement home in California.  Please don't forget that our invitation to come to see us in California is always an open invitation.  We are still skiing and we'd love to introduce your kids to skiing, as we introduced your parents to the snow over 40 years ago!

And sorry this font is so large-- a computer glitch.

We are very much looking forward to seeing all of you on Friday, 1 March.
Love,
Elizabeth 

Dear Elizabeth,

We--Mom, Dad, I, and the entire Muzaale family--extend our warmest

Marum family, as you support him through his recovery. Our thoughts

Thank you D for the very encouraging message.  I think I should count my blessings instead of worrying about things I cannot change.  I will take your advise and believe me, I will do everything I possibly can to keep fit and eat the right food.  I am generally okay. My biggest problem is perhaps the little knowledge I know about health problems.  Otherwise with the LDL cholestral of 6.3 when the normal one is 5.2 should not make me lose sleep.  The doctor said my sugar level is okay although slightly above normal.  He did not give me medication for it.  As I told you I am on a cholestrol loweriang medication for two months. Will update you after that time.

Dad is okay and he sends his love.
Have a good day.

Mummy,

Ignorance may be bliss... but I'm glad that you are aware of these things... and that you are actively influencing your future health!!!

Otherwise, it is a known fact that arteries harden (arteriosclerosis) as you grow older. Of course one wants them to harden at as slow a pace as possible... thus the fish eating & regular exercise.

Don't be disappointed with your progress. The question to ask is this: HOW HEALTHY WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN IF YOU'D BEEN EATING RECKLESSLY FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS? So... what you've been doing (well planned diet, carefully cooked, fish... & exercise) has been very important. If you hadn't been doing these things, perhaps you'd be like the woman in the clinic at 13. While your mind may be at peace when you don't these fact, your body will not be at peace!!!

Kale... let me end there. I'm very fine. No worries at all. Had a wonderful time in Atlanta with your 'bidukulu.' They are very charming!

Meanwhile, the email address to the marum's doesn't seem right. It bounced!!! marum@zm.cdc.gov actually didn't seem right. There usually is a number before or after the name... and another letter from the first name... or something like that.

Anyway, please confirm the correct address... and have a wonderful week.

Dear Elizabeth,

Thank you so much for the updates. I promptly informed Mom & Dad, who are currently visiting the village, where there is no internet access, about your email response. Expect an email form them within the next few days.

Otherwise, I'm really glad to learn of Larry's quick recovery, which speaks of his resilience. I hope this also anticipates his sturdy response to chemotherapy.

It is nice to hear of your intentions, in spite of uncertainty, of visiting Africa again. Please don't hesitate to reach me via email (amuzaal1@jhmi.edu) or cell phone (240-281-3154) whenever you wish to update Mom and Dad about anything. They may not always be very quick to respond to emails. Or they may not be accessible via cell phone because they visit the village, where there is poor coverage, very often.

Dear Abimereki and Lucy & Patrick,
So nice to see your names in my email inbox.  Thank you for writing.  
Larry had the surgery (Whipple procedure) which Abimereki knows is a
very major surgery.  However, it seems he had an excellent surgeon and
he has recovered quickly.  I'm sure it helped that in general, Larry
was in good health and in good physical condition.  He was discharged
from the hospital yesterday and we moved into a temporary apartment.  
We are awaiting news of the pathology report on the lymph nodes which
were removed during the surgery.  This will tell us if there is
detectable spread of the cancer.  The surgeon has told us that he
recommends 6 months of chemotherapy for all of his patients who have a
Whipple, even if there is no evidence of metastases.  We hope the
chemo will start in several weks, after Larry has recovered from the
surgery.  At this time we do not know if he will get a medical
clearance to return to Zambia after the chemo, but he would certainly
like to return even if it's only briefly, as he has not said goodbye
to his Zambian staff and colleagues.

Our future remains unclear.  But based on how quickly he has bounced
back from the surgery, I remain hopeful that he will be able to return
to Africa before too many months go by.  If CDC and the US State
Department do not give him a medical clearance to return officially,
as soon as he is healthy enough we will buy our own tickets and make
every effort to get to our house in Kilifi, Kenya, and we will look
forward to a reunion there with Patrick and Lucy and your families.

I will keep you all posted, and hope to see Patrick and Lucy sometime
in 2011.

Much love,
Elizabeth

Hope you are enjoying your self with the Kayongos.  Our love to you all.  

N.B. Do you have have an idea whether those people sent the forms?  By yesterday they were not there.

Dr. Jonathan,

Following our meeting two weeks ago, during which you generously spared your time, a whole hour, and gave me an overview of the activities of CDC-Uganda, especially regarding the prevention of HIV/AIDS transmission, a topic which I intend to pursue during my studies for the MPH at Johns Hopkins, you advised me to get back to you via email with answers to some specific questions you had raised. That is my purpose in writing to you presently.

First, I will be selecting epidemiology as my area of concentration for the MPH. This, of course, is the result of my persuasions about the central importance of epidemiology in public health, a notion you very aptly reinforced in me during our one-hour chat. Second, there is a capstone written project that every MPH student must submit in their last term before graduation. The breadth of possible topics and formats is liberal, and I list a few examples of projects submitted by previous students at Hopkins below…though these by no means reflect the breadth of topics:

"Reforming the Oral Health Sector in Uganda:  A Primary Health Care Approach"

"Trends and Differentials in Adolescent Sexual Behaviors in Rakai, Uganda, 1994-2002"

"The Persistence of High Malaria Morbidity in Under-5 Children in the West Province of Cameroon"

These examples suggest that I could have an opportunity to work with CDC-Uganda for my capstone project. And this is, I believe, the main issue you wanted me to clarify before calling on you again. Additionally, you asked that I remind you to propose a topic on which I may work, and in so doing, "test the waters", in way of a head-start, before the commencement of my studies this summer.

 
I will eagerly await your reply, though I am fully aware of how busy you must be, and how difficult it may be for you to find some time to respond to this email. But believe me, I will remain yours truly,
